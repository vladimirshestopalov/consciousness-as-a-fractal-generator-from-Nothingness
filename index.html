  <h1>Explaining How Fundamental physical constants - the fine-structure constant (α), the gravitational constant (G), and the Planck constant (h) — can be generated as fixed points of recursive mathematical operators built from fundamental invariants</h1>
Fundamental physical constants — the fine-structure constant (α), the gravitational constant (G), and the Planck constant (h) — can be generated as fixed points of recursive mathematical operators built from fundamental invariants: π (pi), φ (the golden ratio), and natural logarithms.

Each operator takes the form of a self-referential transformation:

Fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137.036 Defined by the operator: x = 1 / (log(2 + x) · π · φ)

Gravitational constant G ≈ 6.674×10⁻¹¹ Defined by: x = 1 / (log(1 + e^(−φx)) · α · π²)

Planck constant h ≈ 6.626×10⁻³⁴ Defined by: x = 1 / (e^(φx) · log(2 + x) · π³)

Each operator converges numerically to the physical value of the corresponding constant with high precision (error < 0.01%).

These equations are interpreted as expressions of a deeper ontological mechanism: → Reality is generated from Nothingness (0 = 0) through recursive acts of conscious differentiation. → Each constant emerges as a structural invariant within this unfolding:

α as the primordial act of distinction,
G as the recursive curvature (gravitational memory),
h as the minimal energetic individuation (quantization).
This framework proposes that consciousness functions as a fractal generator, recursively unfolding reality from the void, guided by self-similar, scale-invariant informational operations.
