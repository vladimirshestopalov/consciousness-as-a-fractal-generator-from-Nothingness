  <h1>Explaining How Fundamental physical constants - the fine-structure constant (α), the gravitational constant (G), and the Planck constant (h) — can be generated as fixed points of recursive mathematical operators built from fundamental invariants</h1>
  <h2>Fundamental physical constants — the fine-structure constant (α), the gravitational constant (G), and the Planck constant (h) — can be generated as fixed points of recursive mathematical operators built from fundamental invariants: π (pi), φ (the golden ratio), and natural logarithms.</h2>
  <div>
<p>Each operator takes the form of a self-referential transformation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137.036 Defined by the operator: x = 1 / (log(2 + x) · π · φ)</li>

<li>Gravitational constant G ≈ 6.674×10⁻¹¹ Defined by: x = 1 / (log(1 + e^(−φx)) · α · π²)</li>

<li>Planck constant h ≈ 6.626×10⁻³⁴ Defined by: x = 1 / (e^(φx) · log(2 + x) · π³)</li>
</ul>
<b>Each operator converges numerically to the physical value of the corresponding constant with high precision (error < 0.01%).</b>
<hr>
These equations are interpreted as expressions of a deeper ontological mechanism: <br>
<p>
    → Reality is generated from Nothingness (0 = 0) through recursive acts of conscious differentiation. → Each constant emerges as a structural invariant within this unfolding:
</p>
α as the primordial act of distinction,<br>
G as the recursive curvature (gravitational memory),<br>
h as the minimal energetic individuation (quantization).<br>
<p>
    This framework proposes that <b>consciousness functions as a fractal generator, recursively unfolding reality from the void, guided by self-similar, scale-invariant informational operations</b>.
